Hey friend,

Thanks for stopping by. In this repository, you'll find my projects on programming. I want to share my work here because, back in high school, I had to re-create my first game on Processing from scratch because I forgot to backup my code. Ironically, it was a RPG that let players re-live their high school life (in my case, re-writing most of my codes). I learned my lesson the hard way and have since decided to post my future projects on a safer place, like Github!

However, that idea didn't really come together till now, after my first semester at MIT. Now that I have gotten all my stars on Codingbat and passed some levels on the Python Challenge, I fell more confident to share my work with you. These projects were critical to my growth as a programmer, and I hope you'll enjoy reading through them.

Warm regards,

Ian
