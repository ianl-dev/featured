# Welcome
Hello, 

Thanks for stopping by. Here, you'll find three of my programming projects in python. The first project, *Flipping Election*, explores how close a presidential election is by treating the election as a knapsack problem to be optimized. The second project, *Modern Blackjack*, provides a text-based approach to playing blackjack. Lastly, *Game of Go* is an on-going effort to building a ML-trained Go bot. 


These projects are critical to my growth as a programmer, and I hope you'll enjoy your stay. 


Warm regards, <br/>
Ian
